# Setting Up and Analyzing Bias-Exchange Metadynamics Simulations: the case of cis-trans isomerization of Peptidyl-Prolyl Peptides

This repository includes the required files and documentation to follow the tutorial on setting up and analyzing molecular dynamics, metadynamics and bias-exchange metadynamics simulations, specifically focusing on the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl peptides.
A tutorial step by step description is provided in the document: https://github.com/fabsugar/plumed-tutorial-be-aapak/blob/main/protocol1_md-meta-be.pdf.

The files `practical1.zip`, `practical2.zip` and `practical3.zip` contain the necessary input files to perform the tutorial.
These files and be unpacked via `unzip practical1.zip` etc.
